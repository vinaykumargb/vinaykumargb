# Hello, stranger! :wave:

I am passionate about programming or coding. Currently focusing on web development. Here, I will be creating some projects when I get some cool ideas. 

### Some random facts about me

* If I learn new features in any languages; I will do some research untill I feel I can use anything it has to offer.
* I am always suffer from bugs in my code, but I also, feel them like new opportunity to learn something. ;)
